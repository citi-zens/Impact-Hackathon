# 🧭 Agentic Impact Analyzer — Citi Impact Hackathon 2025

> **Reimagining how organizations understand, predict, and mitigate impact — through autonomous, explainable agents.**

---

## 💡 Hackathon Overview

The **Citi Impact Hackathon 2025** challenges innovators to build technology-driven solutions that create measurable, responsible, and scalable impact — aligning with Citi’s mission of **responsible innovation and sustainable progress**.  

Our team presents **Agentic Impact Analyzer**, a next-generation AI system built on the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** framework.  
It acts as an **autonomous impact intelligence layer** that can plug into any codebase, organization, or service ecosystem to analyze **how every change creates ripple effects across systems, people, and outcomes**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In complex, distributed systems — especially large enterprise or financial infrastructures — it’s nearly impossible to predict the **true impact** of a code change, service update, or configuration drift.  

Traditional analysis tools detect failures **after** they occur.  
But **impact**, whether technical, financial, or social, begins **before** the failure — hidden in dependencies, data flows, and design decisions.

**Key challenges include:**
- 🌐 **Fragmented visibility** — Microservices and repositories operate in silos.  
- 🧩 **Hidden dependencies** — A change in one module can affect others indirectly.  
- 🕵️ **Reactive detection** — Failures surface late, leading to costly downtime or data inconsistencies.  
- ⚖️ **Lack of explainability** — Existing AI tools flag issues without context or traceable reasoning.

## 🚀 Our Vision

To build an **Agentic System** that:
- **Understands code, not just syntax.**  
- **Maps real-world impact across interconnected systems.**  
- **Provides explainable, proactive insights** on what could go wrong — and why.  

The **Agentic Impact Analyzer** uses **autonomous MCP-based agents** connected to different ecosystems like GitHub, Neo4j, and internal code repositories to continuously analyze relationships, simulate changes, and report potential impact across services.

## 🧩 Solution Summary

**Agentic Impact Analyzer** is a modular and protocol-driven system that leverages:
- **MCP Agents** — Specialized autonomous agents for parsing, graphing, and analyzing code.  
- **AST + Graph Intelligence** — Constructs dependency graphs from repositories and stores relationships in Neo4j for cross-repo analysis.  
- **Impact Scoring Model** — Evaluates the magnitude and reach of potential impact using AI-driven heuristics.  
- **Explainable Analysis Reports** — Each insight is traceable to its source, dependency chain, and reasoning path.  

Together, these components enable an ecosystem that can **self-learn, self-assess, and self-explain** — aligning with Citi’s pursuit of responsible, interpretable AI for enterprise-grade systems.

## 💬 Hackathon Theme Alignment

This project embodies Citi’s **Impact Hackathon ethos** by combining:
- **Innovation** — A new paradigm of agentic, protocol-based analysis.  
- **Responsibility** — Explainable AI that doesn’t just automate but justifies decisions.  
- **Scalability** — Built on interoperable MCP agents that can plug into any codebase.  
- **Sustainability** — Designed to prevent cascading failures, data waste, and human inefficiency.

## 🏁 Outcome

By the end of the hackathon, the Agentic Impact Analyzer demonstrates:
- A working prototype of **autonomous agents** connecting multiple MCP servers (GitHub, AST, Neo4j).  
- **Graph-based impact visualization** derived from real codebases.  
- **Natural-language reasoning** behind each impact prediction.  
- **Extensible architecture** capable of onboarding any microservice or language with minimal effort.
